Android is so popular right now. Because of its popular. There are many kinds of Android 
devices. And each android devices have their custom ROM. Even they have the same android system level. 

But there is a bad influence about the various android custom ROM. The same widget in android like Progress Bar. Maybe will looks different in different android ROM. So I build 
this Custom Progress Bar, want to make the Progress Bar widget will looks exactly same in different devices. 

In this Custom Progress Bar, you can change the circle and bar color to every color you want. And you can just set the Custom Progress Bar's property just in the xml. That's also will works.
